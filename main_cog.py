R!radio is really scary because idk how stable it will be if you type a command while it's still adding songs
R!radio seems fine for now though
R!lyrics have formatting issues cause by <a> tags which is so annoying
play_music() sometimes doesn't play certain songs... i think this is an FFMPEG issue
